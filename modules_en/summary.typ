I am a masterâ€™s student highly interested and talented in *robotics*. My main domains of interest lie at the intersection of *Control Theory and Machine Learning*. Additionally, I have experience working on larger robotics projects with *ROS2*. I have a great overview of the technologies and tools needed to develop and research in the field of robotics.
